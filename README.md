# Description
Snack & Chill is a simple JS-based command-line tool that allows to generateÂ random movies and snacks. 
The data was fetched from two seperated source : 
1. Movie: 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3' 
2. Snacks:  db.json file

 Afterwards, we used math.random to generate random movies & snacks to our button. 

 Finally, we added a comment section, that once submitted will display it.
